## Plugin helper
There is a plugin that you can enable which will notify you if you use the mouse for an action that could have been a shortcut. Try it out.

## ctrl + w
The command `ctrl +  w` is used to intelligently expand the selection. That means that it will start with variables, then blocks, then methods etc.

It is incredibly useful, and you should definitely be using it.

If you go too far, go a step back with `ctrl + shift + w`

## ctrl + b
This is used to follow definitions and usages. Place the cursor in a variable or a method 

## ctrl + q

## shift + arrows
